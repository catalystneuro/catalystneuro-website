At CatalystNeuro, we are passionate about fostering global collaborations that advance the frontiers of neuroscience research and education. Recently, we had the distinct opportunity to contribute to the African Brain Data Science Academy, an initiative under the African Brain Data Network aimed at enhancing data science skills across the continent.

### **The Importance of Global Collaboration in Neuroscience**

In the field of neuroscience, the challenges are as vast as the opportunities. Advancing our understanding of the brain requires not only sophisticated technology but also unparalleled collaboration across borders. The African Brain Data Science Academy embodies this spirit by bringing together experts and learners to share knowledge and tools essential for cutting-edge research. At CatalystNeuro, we believe that open data and open science are crucial for these collaborative efforts.

### **CatalystNeuroâ€™s Role and Contributions**

Our team at CatalystNeuro played a pivotal role in curriculum development and teaching at the academy. We focused on providing practical, hands-on training in data analysis techniques that are vital for neurophysiological research. Our goal was to empower students with the skills needed to manage, analyze, and share data effectively, adhering to the principles of open science.

### **Impacts and Outcomes**

Teaching at the academy was an enriching experience, not just for the students but for us as educators. Witnessing the enthusiasm and dedication of the students was truly inspiring. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing the students collaborate on projects that applied their new skills in real-world scenarios, bridging theory with practical application. The immediate impact of the academy was evident in the students' ability to engage with complex data sets and contribute to ongoing research projects. Looking forward, these experiences have paved the way for further collaborations. Many students expressed interest in contributing to open-source projects and even starting their initiatives.

The African Brain Data Science Academy is just one example of how global collaboration can significantly impact education and research in neuroscience. At CatalystNeuro, we are committed to continuing our support for such initiatives, helping to build a more connected and knowledgeable world.
