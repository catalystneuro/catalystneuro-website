This year, CatalystNeuro had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) 2024 conference, a cornerstone event where the brightest minds in neuroscience converge to explore cutting-edge research and methodologies. Our participation was marked by a fruitful tutorial, engaging discussions, and the invaluable chance to connect with fellow researchers and enthusiasts in the field.

### **Workshop on Data Conversion and Publishing**

One of the highlights of our participation was the workshop led by myself, along with Ryan Ly from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The workshop focused on practical skills essential for the neurophysiology community—specifically, how to convert data to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and how to publish it on the DANDI archive. This session not only provided hands-on experience but also emphasized the importance of open data and reproducible research in advancing neuroscience.

The workshop was well-received, drawing a diverse group of participants eager to learn about NWB and DANDI. Their enthusiasm reaffirmed our commitment to open science and the significant role it plays in fostering collaborative and transparent research.

### **Networking and Outreach at Our Booth**

Beyond the workshop, CatalystNeuro’s presence was also highlighted by our booth, managed by myself and Alessandra Trapani. Throughout the conference, our booth served as a hub for engaging with attendees, discussing our mission and services, and sharing information about upcoming events and opportunities within CatalystNeuro.

The booth allowed us to meet with researchers from various institutions, learn about their work and challenges, and explore potential collaborations. It was inspiring to see so much interest in open data initiatives and how they can propel neurophysiological research forward.

### **Looking Forward**

As we reflect on our experiences at Cosyne 2024, we are more energized than ever to continue our work. The connections made and insights gained have further solidified our resolve to support the neuroscience community through our expertise in research software engineering and our dedication to open data.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who attended our workshop and visited our booth. Your engagement and feedback are crucial to our growth and success. We look forward to seeing you at future events and hope to continue fostering strong partnerships and advancing the frontiers of neuroscience research.
