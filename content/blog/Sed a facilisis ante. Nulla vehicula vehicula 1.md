## Embracing Work and Play at Villa Mas Sant Jordi

In the heart of the Costa Brava, just a stone's throw from the bustling city of Barcelona and the serene beaches of the Mediterranean, CatalystNeuro recently found a perfect fusion of work and relaxation at Villa Mas Sant Jordi. Our annual company retreat was not only a chance to bond and brainstorm but also to immerse ourselves in the splendor of Spanish culture and nature.

### A Villa That Feels Like a Dream

Villa Mas Sant Jordi, a splendid property with 15 air-conditioned bedrooms accommodating up to 40 guests, offered more than just a place to stay—it provided a luxurious experience amidst 30 hectares of private land. Surrounded by cultivated fields and lush forests, the villa featured a vast lawn with an XXL fenced pool, a soccer field, and multiple playgrounds, ensuring leisure was never far away.

The villa itself, recently renovated and decorated in the traditional Catalan style, boasted large vaulted dining rooms, cozy living spaces, and modern amenities like high-speed Wi-Fi and 24-hour technical assistance. Each space within the villa was designed to offer comfort and inspire productivity, from the airy conservatories overlooking the countryside to the playroom filled with toys and books for moments of leisure.

### A Week of Productive Collaboration and Cultural Immersion

Our week at Villa Mas Sant Jordi was meticulously planned to balance hard work with enriching activities. Here’s a glimpse of our schedule:

* **Sunday:** We kicked off with a warm welcome and a delicious Paella dinner, setting the tone for a week of collaboration and cultural exploration.
* **Monday:** The day was filled with talks, group discussions, and a Spanish barbecue in the evening, allowing us to delve into professional growth while enjoying local flavors.
* **Tuesday:** After a morning of productive work sessions, we engaged in a lively soccer game right at the villa—a great way to energize and foster team spirit.
* **Wednesday:** Post morning work sessions, we explored the historic city of Girona, walking through its medieval streets and soaking in its rich heritage.
* **Thursday:** The day was dedicated to creativity and inspiration, with professional headshots in the morning and a visit to the surreal world of the Dalí Museum in the afternoon.
* **Friday:** Our final full day was a mix of work and leisure, culminating in a relaxing lunch near the beach, followed by a beach visit and a scenic hike.

### Reflecting on Our Retreat

As we checked out on Friday, it was clear that our retreat at Villa Mas Sant Jordi had been a monumental success. It wasn't just about the stunning location or the luxurious accommodations; it was about how the environment fostered an atmosphere of open dialogue and creative exchange. The serene settings, the comfortable workspaces, and the plethora of activities provided a perfect backdrop to reflect, connect, and innovate.

We're returning to our roles at CatalystNeuro recharged and more connected than ever, carrying with us not just the memories of a delightful retreat but also the seeds of new ideas and projects sparked in those five transformative days.
