  bustling city of Barcelona and the serene beaches of the Mediterranean,
  CatalystNeuro recently found a perfect fusion of work and relaxation at Villa
  Mas Sant Jordi. Our annual company retreat was not only a chance to bond and
  brainstorm but also to immerse ourselves in the splendor of Spanish culture
  and nature.

### A Week of Productive Collaboration and Cultural Immersion

Our week at Villa Mas Sant Jordi was planned to balance hard work with enriching activities. Here’s a glimpse of our schedule:

* **Sunday:** We kicked off with a warm welcome and a delicious Paella dinner, setting the tone for a week of collaboration and cultural exploration.
* **Monday:** The day was filled with talks, group discussions, and a Spanish barbecue in the evening, allowing us to delve into professional growth while enjoying local flavors.
* **Tuesday:** After a morning of productive work sessions, we engaged in a lively soccer game right at the villa—a great way to energize and foster team spirit.
* **Wednesday:** Post morning work sessions, we explored the historic city of Girona, walking through its medieval streets and soaking in its rich heritage.
* **Thursday:** The day was dedicated to creativity and inspiration, with professional headshots in the morning and a visit to the surreal world of the Dalí Museum in the afternoon.
* **Friday:** Our final full day was a mix of work and leisure, culminating in a relaxing lunch near the beach, followed by a beach visit and a scenic hike.
