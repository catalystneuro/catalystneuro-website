      <description>The CatalystNeuro team worked with Dr. Hussaini and his lab to utilize a state-of-the-art preprocessing workflow on electrophysiological data collected as part of their research on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Data was being collected from the Axona acquisition system and from Intan. They used MountainSort and were interested in comparing these results to other cutting-edge spike sorters and accelerating data processing through curation using spike train metrics, consensus across sorters, and finally manual curation.</description>

      <description>DANDI is a BRAIN-funded project to build an archive for publicly sharing cellular neurophysiology data collected by the BRAIN Initiative. Our role in the project is to build support for NWB files, and to help the DANDI team reach out to NWB users to build a library of data.&#xA;https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000055/draft</description>

      <description>We worked with the labs of Dr. Edward Chang, Dr. Nitin Tandon, and Dr. Mark Richardson to use NWB 2.0 as a foundation for standardizing ECoG data. Through this effort we have restructured internal tools to work with the NWB format, and have publicly released high density ECoG recordings during speech on DANDI here . Through this project, we built:&#xA;ecogVIS, a python GUI for visualizing and annotation of raw voltage traces and standard Chang Lab ECoG preprocessing</description>

      <description>We are leading the data scientist for a collaboration between Ivan Soltesz (lead PI), Gyorgy Buzsaki, Atilla Losonczy, and Mark Schnitzer to elucidate the cellular mechanisms of hippocampal sharp wave ripples using calcium imaging, electrophysiology and large scale simulation. Our role is to help these groups collaborate, sharing data and analyses through the NWB 2.0 standard, and promote standardization in the broader neuroscience community. We worked with the large scale simulation teams across several groups to establish a standard for simulation output as an NWB extension, and a converter from the SONATA format to NWB 2.</description>
